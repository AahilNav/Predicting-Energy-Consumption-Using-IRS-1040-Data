## Can we predict Chicago zip code thermal and electricity usage using tax data?  
- We perform a modeling exersize with useful academic/policy extensions using 2009 US Individual Income Tax Return data and City of Chicago energy usage data.
- Our principal goal is to provide a novel avenue for prediction.  We also seek to test whether there is a clear relationship between real energy consumption and 'Nonbusiness Energy Property Credits' + 'Residential Energy Efficient Property Credits'.
